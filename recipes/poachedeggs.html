        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Like the title says, these are farm-fresh eggs. The egg white on farm-fresh eggs are not watery, which leads to a cleaner looking poached egg. 
            While this will work for store-bought eggs, you will need to strain off the excess liquid using a fine-mesh sieve.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, whole, raw, fresh</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
                <p>Fill a wide pan with 4 cups water (about 3 inches deep) and bring to a boil over high heat. 
                    Once the water boils, turn the heat down to just below a simmer (there should be no bubbles).  
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Crack eggs open into a ramekin. Transfer eggs into a soup ladle, and working quickly and gently, 
                    angle your soup ladle so the eggs slip into the water. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Set a timer for 3 minutes. After 3 minutes, use a slotted spoon to lift your eggs from the water, one at a time. Give each a little jiggle to check that the whites are set. 
                    If not, dip back in for 30 seconds more. Remove and serve immediately with salt and pepper. Your yolk should run when pierced with a fork.
